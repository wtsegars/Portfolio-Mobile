        <p> My name is Will Segars, I was born in Atlanta, GA and was raised
        in Roswell, GA. I graduated from the University of Georgia in 
        2016 with a major in journalism and two certificates (that acted
        as a double minor) in music business and new media. While I was 
        in college, I got my first exposure to coding through an introductory
        web development class that I took as an elective. Not only did I 
        enjoy the class a lot (so much so that it ended up becoming my
        most favorite class I ever took), I noticed that I was very good
        at what I was doing in the class. Later on, I decided to enroll
        in a "Coding Boot Camp" through Georgia Tech in order to hone the 
        skills that I already had and to learn about coding in depth in 
        hopes of pursuing a career in software development.
